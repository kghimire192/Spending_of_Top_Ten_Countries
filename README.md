# Spending Behavior of Top 10 Countries

The project aims to understand the spending behavior (on education, healthcare and military) of the top 10 countries (of G20). There is a comparison of expenditure on different sectors to the country’s GDP (expenditure on a certain sector as a % of their GDP). Similarly, there is a comparison of military expenditure to the countries’ education and healthcare expenditure. Similarly, there is correlation analysis between per capita expenditure on each of the sectors and per capita GDP. Finally, the fastest growing countries in education and healthcare spending have been identified.
